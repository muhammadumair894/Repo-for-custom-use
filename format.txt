Project Proposal: Predictive Model for Forecasting Stock Prices

Overview:
The aim of this project proposal is to develop a predictive model for forecasting the closing prices of a specific stock. The project revolves around utilizing historical stock price data, implementing machine learning techniques, and evaluating the model's performance. The project's intended result is to create a reliable tool for predicting future stock prices, which can be invaluable for investors and traders in making informed financial decisions.

Background:
Stock price prediction has always been of great interest to financial analysts, investors, and traders. Accurate forecasting can provide insights into potential price movements, helping market participants make informed decisions about buying, selling, or holding specific stocks. The use of machine learning algorithms has gained prominence in recent years due to their ability to process large amounts of data and uncover hidden patterns that can contribute to more accurate predictions(Huang and Peissl, 2023).

Research:
The research involved in this project primarily revolves around scholarly articles mentioning the new models used to predict the closing prices of a stock market as well as trying and testing already made models and how they may train their model for prediction. The research would also be put into the different factors/variables that makes the stock market move. If the research is successful in finding and evaluating those variables, a robust and accurate model can be created. Research would also be put into tracking live events for prediction as a factor. The development would be done in phases.
The data pre-processing phase will involve utilizing libraries such as pandas and numpy to clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis. This includes handling missing values, normalizing the data, and splitting it into training and testing sets.
For now the core of the project lies in implementing the LSTM model, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is particularly effective in capturing and utilizing long-term dependencies in sequential data but that can easily change If I am able to find a better model. The LSTM model will be built using the Keras library, which provides a user-friendly interface for designing and training neural networks.
For the testing phase, a portion of the historical data will be used for training, while another portion will be set aside for testing. The model will be trained using the training data, and its predictions will be compared against the actual prices from the testing data. To evaluate the accuracy evaluation metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE) will be used.


Build:
The proposed plan for project build involves the following steps:
Data Collection: Collection of data to train the model, this can be obtained using APIs
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data by handling missing values and transforming the data into a suitable format and using all the cleaning methods for suitable use.
Model Development: Implementing the new model. The model architecture will consist of multiple  layers for prediction.
Model Training: Split the pre-processed data into training and testing sets. Train the model on the training data and monitor its performance during the training process.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model using the testing data. Calculate metrics such as RMSE to assess the accuracy of the model's predictions.
Model Deployment: Once the model has been trained and evaluated, it can be used to make predictions on unseen data. Implement a mechanism to input new data, preprocess it using the same steps as before, and utilize the trained model to generate predictions for future closing prices.

Objectives: Objective 1:
The first objective of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models for stock price prediction. This involves conducting a thorough investigation into the performance of LSTM models using historical stock market data. By analyzing the strengths and limitations of LSTM models in comparison to other prediction techniques, we aim to determine their suitability and accuracy in capturing stock price trends(Gers, Schmidhuber and Cummins, 2000). The objective also includes measuring the reliability of the LSTM model and its ability to make accurate predictions(Gers, Schmidhuber and Cummins, 2000). This is to get our foot in to using a model to predict stock prices.

Objective 2:
Another objective is to explore alternative prediction models for stock price analysis. This objective entails researching and analysing various machine learning and statistical models commonly used in the field, such as ARIMA, SVM, and random forests. By comparing the performance of these models against the LSTM model in terms of accuracy and efficiency, we can identify their respective strengths and weaknesses and evaluate their applicability to different types of stock market data.

Objective 3:
A key objective of the project is to stay updated with new trends in artificial intelligence (AI) that are impacting stock market analysis. This involves conducting in-depth research into recent advancements in AI and their specific implications for stock price prediction. Techniques such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing will be studied in the context of stock market analysis. The objective is to identify innovative approaches and methodologies that leverage AI to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of stock price prediction.

Objective 4:
The project aims to develop a highly accurate stock price prediction model that outperforms existing approaches. The model will be enhanced by incorporating additional features, such as sentiment analysis of news and social media data, to capture the impact of external factors on stock prices. Through careful parameter tuning and feature selection techniques, the model's performance will be optimized to achieve higher accuracy and reliability.

Objective 5:
To further enhance the prediction model, the project will focus on gathering additional data and investigating the influence of news on stock market prices. This objective includes collecting and incorporating relevant data sources, such as financial news articles and social media sentiment, into the prediction model. By studying the correlation between recent news events and stock market movements, we aim to identify meaningful insights that can be incorporated into the model. The objective is to determine how recent news affects stock market prices and implement strategies to capture this influence effectively.

Objective 6:
In order to explore advanced AI algorithms for stock price prediction, the project aims to investigate cutting-edge techniques. This objective involves studying algorithms such as deep neural networks, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and attention mechanisms. By analyzing the advantages and challenges associated with these advanced AI algorithms, we can determine their potential to improve the accuracy and robustness of the prediction model. The objective is to assess if and how these algorithms can be integrated or adapted to enhance the stock price prediction capabilities of the model.

Objective 7:
In addition to the technical objectives, the project recognizes the importance of finding a good working design scheme that promotes effectiveness and ease of work. One potential approach is the use of Gantt charts, which can help in planning and scheduling project tasks, tracking progress, and managing project timelines. By employing a well-designed project management framework, I aim to ensure efficient workflow and successful execution of the project.

Legal Social and Ethical Issues:

Can it be that some people might find the productive offensive?
There have already been models created that are similar to the AI that I will create. Predictive models are far from offensive, notwithstanding the doubts some people have about new artificial intelligence technologies. However a model can be considered offensive because an AI that predicts stock prices much more intelligently than humans could undermine the fundamental principles that govern how a stock market operates and lead to unintended consequences, even though it is extremely unlikely that the model will behave better than humans.


Will you be using copyright material? How will you get permission to use it?
	To comprehend their reasoning and how they improved their models, I would be using working models created by other engineers. I will reference their paper or GitHub repository in my report using this material.
Does the product adhere to accepted standards and is it secure enough to hold data? In case you are dealing with confidential data have you seek advice from the Ethics Committee?
	Since I would be using publicly accessible data, its security is not necessary; but, since the work would be done locally and with Python libraries on Jupyter, its security would be secured. Although it’s worth mentioning data integrity in this scope has to be more thoroughly studied.
Who will you interview?
	Most likely, I'll interview my friends to get their feedback on the model. If I have to divulge their names, I'll ask them to sign a consent form. The process will probably involve me sending them an online questionnaire, which they may respond to and share their ideas on.

Critical success factors

The success of the project relies heavily on the critical activities, people, and resources involved. One critical activity is obtaining accurate and relevant data. If the model is trained on unreliable or incorrect data, its decision-making abilities will be compromised, rendering the model ineffective. To mitigate this risk, it is essential to ensure the data used for training is carefully selected, validated, and regularly updated to maintain accuracy.
Another critical factor is the performance of the AI model. There is inherent risk associated with the complexity of accurately predicting stock prices. The model's performance may not meet expectations or fail to outperform existing models due to unpredictable market conditions and unforeseen factors. To address this risk, rigorous testing and evaluation processes should be implemented to assess the model's performance against historical data and benchmark it against existing models. This helps identify areas for improvement and refinement.
One crucial step in managing the risks is the implementation of continuous monitoring and improvement practices. By setting up monitoring systems, any deviations or anomalies in the model's performance can be detected promptly. Regular monitoring allows for proactive adjustments and refinements to the model based on new data and market insights. This iterative approach ensures the model stays up to date and maintains optimal performance over time.
